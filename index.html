            <p>I am an enthusiastic developer with a strong passion for web technologies,
                 finding joy in crafting a wide range of projects, from sleek business websites to dynamic, 
                 interactive web applications. </p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Check out some of my works below and completed course.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, each one presenting unique challenges
                     that have helped me grow as a developer. From simple landing pages to complex web applications, 
                    I've always strived to deliver high-quality, user-friendly solutions.</li>

                <li>I have applied my JavaScript skills to various projects, from creating interactive websites and web 
                    applications to developing scripts for automation and data manipulation. Each project has not only honed my technical ablities but also deepened my understanding of 
                    how JavaScript can be leveraged to solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.</li>

                <li>During my high school years, I was actively engaged in exploring various academic subjects 
                    and extracurricular activities. I maintained a strong academic record, consistently challenging
                     myself with advanced coursework and seeking opportunities to deepen my understanding of subjects 
                     like mathematics, science, and languages. Outside the classroom, I participated in several clubs 
                     and organizations, including debate club and community service initiatives, where I developed valuable 
                     leadership and teamwork skills. My high school experience not only prepared me academically but also 
                     instilled in me a passion for lifelong learning and personal growth.
